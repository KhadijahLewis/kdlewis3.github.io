    <p>I am a life-long learner. I strive to learn and be involved  at every level. My goal is to always lead with learning something new as well  as helping others gain understanding with a concept or skill. When I keep those  things at the forefront, I stay true to my morals and beliefs.</p>
	  
	  <p> My journey into tech hasnâ€™t been easy. It has included long nights and early mornings with studying, tutoring, and grasping new concepts. I feel that this is a career path that requires patience, guidance, and ultimately perseverance because on multiple occasions things can get extremely frustrating. My temperament is laid back and takes more than the average person for me to throw in the towel. I am always eager to gain more skills to add to my toolbox. </p>
