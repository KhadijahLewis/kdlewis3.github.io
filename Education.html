<p>I attended North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State  University. I began my studies in nursing, which I realized sooner than later I  wasn't fond of. My experience in nursing consisted of clinicals and labs that  allowed me to practice in real time as a nurse. I&rsquo;ve completed simulators,  which taught me how to draw blood from a patient, etc. Fast forward to junior  year I made a major change into physical therapy. I graduated in 2017 with a bachelor&rsquo;s  of science in sports science fitness management.</p>

  <p>I took an intro course at NC State for cybersecurity. Once I  learned that this was something I could do I enrolled at Wake Tech 2-year  program. I am currently still enrolled.</p>
